            Helpful hints:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Include a URL copied &amp; pasted from the address bar of your browser so that potential buyers can see exactly what you want.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the item description and URL can't describe exactly what you want, use the <strong>Comment</strong>
                    area to mention anything you feel is necessary.  It doesn't mean the shopper has to buy the item from that website.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you don't know the price of the item, simply enter <strong>0</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Try not to set all your items at the same ranking level.  When someone is shopping for you, they'll rely on the ranking to know what you want the most.  If you don't think there are enough levels, or the descriptions aren't adequate, ask an administrator to add or change them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The quantity field indicates the number of that item that you want.  Once that many are bought or reserved, no more will be available.  If you have no limit on how many you want, enter 999 (for example).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
